           <b> Santa Rosa City: Two Hundred Twenty-Six Years of History</b>
            <br><br>
            A brief historical perspective of Santa Rosa City to help guide current planning efforts. 
            It provides a chronological narrative tracing the city's development through various periods:
             Barrio Bukol, Revolutionary Period, American Period, Sakdalista Revolt Period, Japanese Period, 
             and Post-War Period. This historical context aims to inform planners about the necessary 
             interventions for sustainable development. A detailed list of local chief executives and 
             the periods they served is included at the end of the chapter.

             <br>From Barrio Bukol<br>
           
             During the early period, Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo, the grandson of Miguel Lopez de
             Legaspi, explored the Laguna Lake area and found settlements of native people along the coast.
             One of these areas, known as "Tabuco," included what are now the towns of Cabuyao and Biñan.
             Santa Rosa was originally a territorial extension of Biñan called Barrio Bukol, likely referring
             to the sloping and elevated western part of the town.

             The text describes a piece of land that is part of the Hacienda Biñan in Laguna, owned by
             the Dominicans since 1644. The Dominicans built a chapel there in 1757, and also established the
             Historical Cuartel de Santo Domingo near the boundary with Silang Cavite. This cuartel served
             to protect lowland residents from bandits coming from Cavite. During the Spanish revolution,
             this area served as a headquarters for reinforcements against Philippine revolutionaries.

             Barrio Bukol in Biñan was a well-established settlement comprising various sitios such as Makinang
             Apoy, Tagapo, Pulong Santa Cruz, Aplaya, and Caingin. The area had a hacienda system similar to 
             the Spanish encomienda system, with a hacienda in the Poblacion area. Doña Juana Galintang, a 
             native woman of the barrio, owned several hectares of grassland, and in recognition of her status,
             the plaza was named after her.
